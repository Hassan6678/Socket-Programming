**"Socket-Programming"** 

Weâ€™ll use the following simple client-server application to demonstrate socket
programming for both **UDP** and **TCP**:
1. The client reads a line of characters (data) from its keyboard and sends the data
to the server.
2. The server receives the data and converts the characters to uppercase.
3. The server sends the modified data to the client.
4. The client receives the modified data and displays the line on its screen.
